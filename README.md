                          A Limbus Company bot that charges through MD5 for you
```

<p align="center"><img src="ImageAssets/readme/preview.png" /></p>

### ‚ö° Speed
Generally, each floor takes no more than 5 minutes, so a full MD5 run lasts between **20‚Äì25 minutes** for a Burn team.

---

# ChargeGrinder:
- ## Starts from any moment of dungeon exploration
  - But it is still recommended to start on main game screen
- ## Supports all team builds (Burn is recommended)
  - ***Pick the right team before starting the bot!***
  - Burn is the fastest team with average time of 23 minutes per run.
  - Recommended team:

---

- ## Selects Floor Packs
  - ### By default:
    - Avoids packs with high mortality rate and long fights such as: <p>
  **The Noon of Violet, Murder on the WARP Express, Full-Stopped by a Bullet, Timekilling Time, Nocturnal Sweeping, To Claim their Bones** and some other.
    - Prioritizes floors with unique ego gifts such as: <p>
  **The Outcast, Hell's Chicken** and some other.
  - ## You can set your own pack priority in config!
    - ***Important note: Prioritized packs are specific to each team type, but Avoided packs apply globally to all teams.***

  <p align="center"><img src="ImageAssets/readme/config.png" /></p>

- ## Selects the best next node
  - The choice priority order: <p>
**Event, Normal fight, Miniboss fight, Risky fight, Focused fight**
  - Mostly the bot just looks at the next 3 nodes, but it will also look 2 nodes ahead if the next node choice is uncertain. 
  - The main purpose of node picking is minimizing time.
  - Bot can detect:
> ![nodes.png](ImageAssets/readme/nodes.png)

- ## Handles battles
  - Winrates focused encounters.
  - Chains skills 1 and 2 for human encounters. 
  - Skill 3 animations take more time than necessary so it is best to avoid it.
  - Doesn't use any EGO, because it is a huge time waste.
> ![skills.gif](ImageAssets/readme/skills.gif)

- ## Selects team-related important EGO gifts
  - EGO gift priority:
    - Gifts that are needed for fuse recepies
    - Highest tier gifts (to fuse later)
    - Same gifts as team affinity

- ## Makes a good team affinity build in shop
  - Fuses gifts to get powerful Tier 4s
  - Upties and buys affinity-related gifts
- ## Restarts if run fails
  - If 6 or more sinners are dead, the bot (with default settings) will restart the run.
- ## Supports Luxcavation grind

<p align="center"><img src="ImageAssets/readme/lux.png" /></p>

- ## Reclicks if action failed
  - Sometimes timings mess up, so in order to address this issue most bot actions are double-verified.

**Limitations:**  
ChargeGrinder still needs additional features, testing, and bug fixes. However, it can successfully grind a few easy dungeons while you are asleep (that's how I do it at least).

# Installation
### üì¶ Option 1: Run the Prebuilt Executable 
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/app.exe-Download-blue.svg)](https://github.com/AlexWalp/Mirror-Dungeon-Bot/releases/download/v1.1.2/app.exe) <p>
- Launch **app.exe** from the `dist` folder‚Äîno additional files required.
- No OCR is used anymore, all detection is now done with open cv.

### üêç Option 2: Run with Python
Make sure you have **Python 3** installed. Then either:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or manually install:
- `opencv-python-headless`
- `numpy`
- `PyQt6`

Then you can run `App.py` for GUI interface or run `Bot.py` for cmd input without GUI.

---
# Usage:
  You can set up sinners and other settings upon program execution. ChargeGrinder will start running in 10 seconds after that. 
  In the meantime you should switch to the Limbus Company window, main screen. It is not recommended to move the mouse while the bot is running, but you can Alt+Tab to another window and the bot will pause.

  <img src="ImageAssets/readme/up_warning.gif"/>
</div>

# Important:
  - ***Game interface must be in English!***
  - Set the in-game resolution to **16:9** ratio (**1920x1080** is best, but **1280x720** also works). Both fullscreen and windowed modes are supported.<p>
  *Make sure that the Limbus Company window is fully visible!*
  - And don't forget to pre-select your team!

# stats.py
- You can run stats.py file from this repository to view your MD run statistics
- Make sure that `file = "game.log"` actually points to your `game.log` file
- Output looks like this:
